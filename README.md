### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is (Jing)Chang Xiao, I am a graduate from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. I've had personal projects in coding on and off ever since University, and have recently gotten more serious about finding a career in the Software Development industry.

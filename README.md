## Welcome to My Github

My name is (Jing)Chang Xiao, I am currently a Fullstack Developer at Mark43, a software provider for public safety agencies across the US.
In this position I work with a wide variety of technologies, from SQL databases, Java backends, Docker containers, to ReactJS frontends.
It has been a great learning experience, and to see how it all connects to form a complex network of custom built systems that would otherwise be handled
by cloud providers like AWS or Azure.

Previously, I headed the development team at BrokerPocket, a private online platform for real estate agents to exchange listings and related information confidentially.
In this position, I worked with some of the same technologies like ReactJS and associated libraries like Redux, but also some different ones like MongoDB and NodeJS based microservices. 
I also worked extensively with Terraform for designing AWS architectural systems, as well as various scripting languages like Bash and Python.
